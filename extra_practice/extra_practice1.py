#Prompt 1:
# Write a program that adds 3 to a variable and prints the new value. 
# The variable should be initialized to 12 before 3 is added to it.
# Bonus: Can you think of another way to write this? 


#Prompt 2:
# Write a program that squares a variable and prints the new value. 
# The variable should be initialized to 5 before it is squared.
# Bonus: Can you think of another way to write this? 


#Prompt 3:
# Write a program that compares two numbers and prints whether or not the first number is greater than the second number.
# You can test your program using different numbers.
# Bonus: Can you make the program print "is greater" when the first number is greater and print "is smaller" when the first is smaller. 


#Prompt 4:
# Write a program that prints whether or not a number is divisble by 5.
# You can test your program using different numbers.
# Bonus: Can you make the program print "yes" is the number is divisible and "no" if the number isn't divisible?


#Prompt 5:
# Write a program that implements this equation: 5x + 2
# x is a varible and that you can assign different values to in order to test your program.
# Example Outputs --
#   when x is 3, 5(3) + 2 = 17, the output is 17
#   when x is 2, 5(2) + 2 = 12, the output is 12
# Bonus: Can you implement this equation: (5x + 2)^2?
# Example Outputs --
#   when x is 3, (5(3) + 2)^2 = 289, the output is 289
#   when x is 2, (5(2) + 2)^2 = 144, the output is 144
